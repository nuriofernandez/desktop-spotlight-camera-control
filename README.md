# Setup and context

A few months ago, I decided to purchase and install a spotlight on my desktop. I did this to improve the video quality during meetings and calls with friends.
Aditonally, I connected this spotlight to a smart plug/switch so it can be turn on and off with my phone.

Has ilustrated in the following image, I have a spotlight connected with a smart switch and an external camera on top of my monitor.

After the installation of this light, the difference is remarkable.

# The issue

I keep forgetting to turn on that light over and over, having to get my phone and turn it on is not complicated, but it's something I keep forgeting to do.

# This solution

I decided to build this project, a system that checks for camera usage on my compter and a controller to turn on and off the spotlight.
